# pyball

Library for grabbing baseball statistics in Python, designed for use in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Why `pyball`

Another python library for getting baseball statistics already exists ([pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball)), however, pyball just provides barebones functions for retriving stats from Baseball-Reference, and Baseball Savant.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10.12

## Install/Build From Source
```
git clone https://github.com/gdifiore/pyball.git

cd pyball

pip install . OR poetry install
```

## Docs

Read the [docs](https://gdifiore.github.io/pyball/docs/pyball/index.html) for function descriptions.

For examples, look at my [MLBResearch Repo](https://github.com/gdifiore/MLBResearch/blob/main/Parse_BBRef_Table/bbref_table.ipynb) where I test most of the functions.
